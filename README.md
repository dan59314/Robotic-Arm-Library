# Robotic-Arm-Library
My Robotic Arm project and related Libraries.

Import CAD files and perform precise riveting with robotic arms.

After precise positioning and alignment with Camera. We then can establish the coordinate system conversion matrix between the CAD file and the robotic arm.

Finally hundreds of processing points will be completed automatically.

Connect me if you are interested.
